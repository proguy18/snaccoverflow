## Postman-Request:

1) Customer starts a new order by requesting a item (for Customers):
      url: https://snaccs-in-a-van.herokuapp.com/api/customer/order/add/607074c63ed89dee65af788e
      This request attempts to add two Lattes to Nathanael's cart.
      Conditions: 
        POST
        - input: this REST endpoint accepts {"customerId": "<some Customer ObjectId>",
          "quantity": "<amount of item to add to the cart>"}
        - output: this will give a 200 http status and OK if success
        - fault conditions:
          - send {"customerId": "<some valid ID, but nonexisting Customer ObjectId>", 
            "quantity": 1}, then a 404 Not Found will be thrown
          - send {"customerId": "<some random, invalid string>", 
            "quantity": 1}, then a 500 Internal Server Error will be thrown
        - addSnackToCart() in customerContoller.ts

2) Mark an order as \"fulfilled\" i.e. the order is ready to be picked up by customer :
      url: https://snaccs-in-a-van.herokuapp.com/api/order/60780115c5c0362b60d60376/fulfill
      This request marks the order with an ID of 60780115c5c0362b60d60376 as \"Fulfilled\".
      This also set the status message as "fulfilled order" so the customer can be notified.
      Conditions: 
        GET
        - input: this REST endpoint accepts {"orderID": "<some Order ObjectId associated with Vendor>"}
        - output: this will give a 200 http status and OK if success
        - fault conditions:
          - send {"orderID": "<some valid ID, but nonexisting Order ObjectId>"}, then a 404 Not Found will be thrown

          - fault conditions:
            - send {"vendorID": "<some random, invalid string>"}, then a 500 Internal Server Error will be thrown
            - send {"vendorID": "<some valid string, no incomplete orders available for vendor>"}, then an 204 No Content will be thrown.
          - getOutstandingOrders() in vendorController.ts
